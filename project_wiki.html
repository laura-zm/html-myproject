        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Taylor Alison Swift, born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania (United States), has become one of the most influential singer-songwriters of the twenty-first century. Known for her autobiographical writing, her ability to reinvent herself across genres, and her unprecedented commercial success, she stands today as the highest-grossing live performer and one of the best-selling artists in history. Her work has shaped contemporary pop culture, and her impact extends far beyond music.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="wiki-section" id="early-life">
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Taylor grew up in a family that recognized her creative instincts early on. Raised in Pennsylvania,
          she developed a fascination for storytelling and music as a child, eventually teaching herself guitar and writing
          her own songs. Her ambition led her to Nashville at just fourteen years old, a bold move that placed her at the
          heart of the country music industry. This early relocation set the foundation for a career defined by determination,
          discipline, and a rare instinct for narrative songwriting.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="wiki-section" id="career">
        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>
          Taylor’s professional journey began when she signed with Big Machine Records and released her self-titled debut album
          in 2006. The record introduced her as a prodigious young country artist with a gift for capturing teenage emotion.
          Her breakthrough came with Fearless in 2008, an album that transformed her into a global star and produced
          hits such as “Love Story” and “You Belong With Me.” The project earned her multiple Grammy Awards and established
          her as a defining voice of her generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the next decade, she expanded her artistic range with <em>Speak Now</em> and <em>Red</em>, albums that blended
          country roots with pop ambition. Her full transition to pop arrived with <em>1989</em> in 2014, a landmark release that
          reshaped her public image and dominated global charts. She continued to evolve with <em>Reputation</em>, a darker,
          more confrontational record, followed by <em>Lover</em>, which embraced a brighter, more romantic aesthetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the pandemic years, Taylor surprised audiences with <em>Folklore</em> and <em>Evermore</em>, two introspective,
          indie-folk projects that showcased her versatility and earned widespread critical acclaim. She also began re-recording
          her early catalog to regain ownership of her masters, releasing the now-famous “Taylor’s Version” editions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her momentum only intensified in the 2020s. <em>Midnights</em> (2022) broke streaming records, and <em>The Eras Tour</em>
          (2023–2024) became the highest-grossing tour of all time, redefining the scale and cultural impact of live performance.
          In 2024, she released <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em>, a lyrically dense and widely discussed album that further
          cemented her status as a generational storyteller.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 2025, Taylor remains a dominant cultural force, a billionaire artist whose influence spans music, film, fashion,
          and global media. In addition to the continued success of <em>The Eras Tour</em> and her recent albums, she has also
          completed one of the most significant artistic reclamations in modern music history through her re-recordings, which
          reshaped industry conversations about artists’ rights and creative ownership.
        </p>

      <section class="wiki-section" id="eras">
        <h2>Eras</h2>
        <p>
          Taylor’s career is often described through distinct “eras”, each marked by a shift in sound, aesthetics, and narrative focus.
          Her early years were defined by country storytelling and youthful sincerity. The <em>Fearless</em> and <em>Speak Now</em>
          periods elevated her into a fairytale-like figure of American pop-country. With <em>Red</em>, she embraced emotional
          complexity and sonic experimentation, paving the way for the polished pop reinvention of <em>1989</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <em>Reputation</em> era introduced a darker, more defiant persona, while <em>Lover</em> brought a pastel-colored
          return to optimism. The unexpected folk turn of <em>Folklore</em> and <em>Evermore</em> revealed a quieter, literary side
          of her artistry. <em>Midnights</em> reintroduced a sleek, nocturnal pop sound, and <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em>
          explored themes of identity, heartbreak, and creative mythology. Across all these eras, Swift has demonstrated an unmatched
          ability to evolve while maintaining a deeply personal connection with her audience.
